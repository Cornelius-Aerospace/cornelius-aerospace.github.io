# Our history: How did it all start

Cornelius Aerospace has a long and confusing history, one i hope will grow to be even more meaningfull and impactful. Lets delve in, buckle in!

## Founding:
Leah Cornelius "founded" _Cornelius Aerospace_ as a one-woman team back in early 2023 after experiening her first, spectactular rocket launch. From that point she knew her path was that of her child hood dream: space.5

Having dreamt of building a rocket (and even some misguided attempts) since primary school. In Year  (aged 10) she wrote a letter to the national lottery requesting a grant of 1 million GBP to build a _gaint_ stack of estes C4-S motors, esstentially get to space with (if she recalls correctly) 172 single use motors.

Sadly (or perhaps luckly, seeing as the idea was drawn out during break time on a pad of paper with no aerodynamic simulations - just the rough approximation of a C4 motor going 300m up and a goal of 80,000m; Rocket science is just simple maths after all)

Years later aged 18 Leah had _alot_ more tools under her belt, having been programing since 13 and playing with some pretty (if i may toot my own horn) complex and aweome microcontroller projects, and apprentiship spent designing pcbs and then soldering 140 of them (more flux was inhaled in that time then any human should - buy a god damn fan past Leah).

Also completing her A-levels (BTEC L3 joint diploma) course in Engineering, she began her path down aero/astronautics.

She began building rockets, using 3D printing and her small wealth. Eventually reaching the size large enough to begin integrating her personal favourite: ELECTRONICS.

She began working on multiple flight computers. 3 of which never flew or either got disected for parts. She is now working on our first-to-flight FC (flight controller): CFlight.

Enough about me (yes 3rd person writing feels odd).

## The formation of a team

Leah realised she was incapble of handling all the elements of a amature space-program, she began to grow hopeless in ever achiving her goals (at the time a measly 10km stratospheric rocket flight with stablised footage).

Leah was in a long-term relationship with **Seth**, the changing factor. She decided to invite him to a rocket launch with the much loved, long-time casper. Go to our blog post on that for some great photos and videos of the launches that day (including a 3D printed rocket that was so underextuded i had to cover it in expoxy and then hold the nosecone on with plaster tape; It _flew_...? in a spiral and writhed. We did rever it so go check that out. It is linked at the bottom of this page **TODO**)
